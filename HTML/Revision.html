    <p>Hi! I'm 25 this year and I am a dedicated, hardworking and independent individual, who enjoys working in a team. Previously as a Computer Science student at NUS, I discovered my passion for Software Engineering and Mathematics. I enjoy learning data structures and taking on new tasks that would allow me to experience new technological frameworks.</p>
